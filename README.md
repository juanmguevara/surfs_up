#### After reviewing and comparing the statistical data from June to December I can see that the majority of the data shows more precipitation during december. Typically there is a higher maximum value in regards to precipitation during December, in comparison to June. This is true during the year 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016. Moreover, we can see that the mean precipitation during December also supersedes June's mean value.

#### Reviewing the station data set we can see that June has much higher precipitation at the specific location but overall December will have a much higher precipitation rate. 

#### In additon, to that we can see that the temperature at the time of observation is much higher during June and lower during December. 

#### I would recommend for further analysis to gather more information on foot/vehicle traffic in the area. The current data set shows that the weather rarley drops below 60 degrees which means it never too cold to be outside, but this alone cannot dictate the success of the surf shop. Adding number of tourists and local attractions near the facility can enhance our prediction of the shops success during the summer and winter time.

#### I would also recommend to have data on when the full moon happens to get a better understanding of when surfers might want to come and surf for the high intense waves.

#### Finally, my last recommendation is to gather data on how far is the surf shop from local cities, buisnesses and resturants. This would help in regards to getting more customers intrested in checking out a surf shop after they have done some eating, shopping or walking around. The closer to a city the more eyes the surf shop will get.
